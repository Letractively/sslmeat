=========================================================================

This file contains 2 sections:
1) Instructions to complie SSLMEAT.
2) Instructions on how to install the root certificates on some devices.

=========================================================================
1) COMPILE SSLMEAT
=========================================================================

sslmeat is written in C++ (g++) and encompasses 2 executables:
1) 'proxy', the http/ssl man-in-the-middle proxy.
2) 'showp', a tool to read the contents of packets saved by 'proxy'

To compile sslmeat, you'll need the following development packages:
* zlib
* sqlite3
* openssl

Compile instructions: just type 'make' ! 

=========================================================================
2) INSTALL CERTIFICATES
=========================================================================

2.1) On an ordinary browser
     ----------------------

Add the file KEYS/ca_cert.pem to the keystore of your browser.

On MS IE8, go to "Internet options", click on the "Content" tab, then on 
"Certificates". Click on the "Import" button and add the certificate as
a "Trusted Root Certification Authority".

An equivalent approach can be used on Firefox, Chrome or Safari. 

Note: if your browser prefers an CRT file instead of a PEM file, you
can easily make the conversion with openssl with the folowing command:
$ openssl x509 -inform PEM -outform DER -in ca_cert.pem -out ca_cert.crt

2.2) On an iPhone
     ------------

Create a webpage containing the file KEYS/ca_cert.pem or send yourself an 
email containing that file. Open the file on the iPhone, and follow the 
instructions to add that certificate as a trusted root certificate.

2.3) On an Android
     -------------

Depending on the android platform you have, different approaches may exist. 

On a Galaxy Tab 10.1, you will need to root the device and use a terminal 
emulator to copy the file /system/etc/security/cacerts.bks to a sdcard. 
Then you should modify that file on a PC with a keystore editor such as 
"Portecle", adding KEYS/ca_cert.pem to the keystore. Copy back the modified 
keystore to the android device and reboot. 

Tip: if the "cp" command does not exist, use "cat source > destination".
